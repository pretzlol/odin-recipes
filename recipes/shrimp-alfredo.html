        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This incredibly simple dish features a rich and luxurious Parmesan cream sauce, 
            tender shrimp, and hearty fettuccine noodles. 
            The simple creamy alfredo sauce is made with butter, 
            garlic, heavy cream, and Parmesan, 
            and it comes together in minutes. 
            Then just add some fettuccine and juicy shrimp, which literally take about three minutes to cook in the skillet, 
            and your fancy-pants pasta is done!
