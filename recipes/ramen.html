    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A beef maruchan ramen dish. Very light colored noodles, with an <strong>addicting</strong> taste. 
        The ramen will be hard whenever you pull them out of the microwave if done correctly. However, you let the ramen 
        sit in hot water, and they will become squishy like regular noodles.
