    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A beef maruchan ramen dish. Very light colored noodles, with an <strong>addicting</strong> taste. 
        The ramen will be hard whenever you pull them out of the microwave if done correctly. However, you let the ramen 
        sit in hot water, and they will become squishy like regular noodles.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        Maruchan Ramen package
        Maruchan Ramen seasoning packet
        Water to where the ramen can be submerged
    </ul>

        Empty the package into the bowl.

        Fill the bowl with water until you can submerge the ramen.
