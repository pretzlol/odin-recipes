First Odin Project.
Hello Odin! This is my first project ever. I am excited for the challenge, and I'm excited to see how easy this looks in the future. This is an HTML-only project. I have learned how to make an html boilerplate. I've learned how to make links, images, and use emphasis and paragraph elements. I've also learned the basic workflow of git.
